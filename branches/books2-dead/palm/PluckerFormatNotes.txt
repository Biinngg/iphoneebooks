Document name is present starting at offset zero through the first NUL byte.  Max length is 32 bytes (incl. training NUL), and unused bytes should be padded with NUL.

For Plucker, the string DataPlkr is present starting at offset 0x3C.  This offset is fixed, and should be the same for all PDB files, I think.  It's the same for all Plucker docs in any case, possibly different for PalmDOC.
