#summary List of outstanding issues before a 1.1.4 official release
#labels Phase-Requirements,todo

= Introduction =

Ideally, 1.1.4 will be bug free, at least for basic startup/reading functionality.  Below is a list of known issues that need to be fixed before a final release.

= Pending: =

 * Fix rotate reflow - text doesn't reflow when changing from landscape to portrait

 * View sliding directions - Particularly when changing chapters, the view transitions don't always go the correct directions.  Might also want to re-evaluate swipe direction for next/prev chapter.

 * Don't transition on snapshot startup - If the startup image isn't a book cover, don't transition after load

 * Hide slider before showing file browser - When transitioning from book to browser, the scroll slider doesn't disappear before the transition

 * Imageview dealloc - image view leaks.  Possibly chapter changes leak as well.  GSLog on all object alloc/dealloc and plug it up!

 * Show HUD sooner - might be possible to pop the HUD in applicationDidFinishLaunching

 * Still some text cut-off at bottom - some documents lose the bottom text

 * Invert goes black on black for many books - some (many??) books don't redraw text color properly

 * Flash of white bg on invert

 * New rotate/lock icon - overlay a lock icon to show rotation lock

  * When an image is displayed, cannot get the navbar and toolbar to slide in. Very important as there is no way to get out of this display short of leaving the app and deleting preference

  * Fix handling of swipe and touch sensitive zone in rotated EBookView

= Installer stuff: =

    * Fix up old symlinks in installer - Remove the old Default.png symlink before installing 

    * Fix up old book paths in installer - Create a separate installer package which will migrate books over - ideally without needing BSD 


= Fixed: =

    * Screenshot nav bars - screenshot doesn't include the navigation bars -ZSB 18-Mar-2008 23:30EDT

    * Smaller default.PNG - remove the oversized old book and replace with something much smaller (filesize)  -ZSB 18-Mar-2008 23:30EDT

    * Store rotate orientation - the current rotation isn't saved/restored, only lock status  -ZSB 18-Mar-2008 23:30EDT

 * File browser read indicator - File read indicator doesn't refresh until file browser repaints the row -ZSB 18-Mar-2008 23:30EDT

 * Status bar color change for invert -ZSB 18-Mar-2008 23:30EDT
