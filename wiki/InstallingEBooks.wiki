This tutorial uses iPHUC to install eBooks into your Media/EBooks directory, where Books.app looks for them.  It is not neccesary to jailbreak your phone to do so--but of course, if you've installed Books.app your phone has already been jailbroken...

This tutorial has been written for Mac OS X.


== Copy books using iPHUC ==

  # Get and install [http://iphuc.googlecode.com/ iPHUC].
  # Plug in your iPhone to your computer.  If iTunes opens, let your phone sync and then quit iTunes.
  # Run iPHUC from the command-line (Terminal.app on a Mac).
  # Type: {{{ ls }}} to see your Media directory.  If you haven't already created an EBooks folder, type {{{ mkdir EBooks }}}.
  # Type: {{{ cd EBooks  }}} to put yourself into the EBooks directory.
  # Assuming you have a text file in your home directory, you can copy it to the EBooks folder by typing {{{ putfile /Users/yourusername/some_book.txt some_book.txt }}} where "yourusername" is your user name.  Note that, at least at this point, iPHUC requires the full path to the file you're copying.
  # If you want a prettier name on the Books.app file browser, you could type {{{ putfile /Users/yourusername/some_book.txt Some\ Book,\ by\ Jane\ Author }}}.  Note you need to escape all spaces with backslashes.
  # If you have a directory which contains a book broken up into chapters, you need to create a new directory and copy over each file separately.  Pain in the neck, but I hope to have a tool to automate this soon.

== Copy books using scp ==

To do this, you must first have enabled SSH on your phone, or it won't work at all, and you must be connected to a Wi-Fi network.

  # Find out your iPhone's IP address: Settings -> WiFi, then click the blue arrow to the right of your checked network.  The IP address will be listed on the next screen.  For the example we'll call it 192.168.1.1.
  # Make sure you don't let your iPhone sleep in the next few steps!
  # If you have one file, you can type: {{{ scp /path/to/file.html root@192.168.1.1:/var/root/Media/EBooks }}} (assuming you've already created the EBooks directory)
  # If you have more than one file in a local directory, for instance a book broken into chapters, you can type {{{ scp -r /path/to/directory root@192.168.1.1:/var/root/Media/EBooks }}}
  # Enter your password and the book will be copied over!
