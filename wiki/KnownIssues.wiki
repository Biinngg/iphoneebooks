= Introduction =

I am aware of the following problems with Books.app.  If you have a new issue, *please do not leave it in the comments to this page--submit it via the Issues tab above!*


= Known Issues =

  * Opening large files, especially plain text, takes a long time.  Sometimes, in fact, it takes so long that if you're launching from the SpringBoard (the main iPhone view, with all the apps, etc.), the iPhone thinks Books.app has crashed, and automatically goes back to the SpringBoard.  If this happens, you will need to remove the Books.app preferences file, so that the program does not automatically open the file on launch.  See RemovingPreferencesFile.  It is strongly recommended that you break up long books into individual chapters.
  * The file browser currently only supports two levels of directories--one level for books (with each book represented by a directory), and a lower level for chapters (which are the individual text or HTML files).  This limitation will be removed in a future release.
  * Text file conversion to HTML is currently very primitive, with all line feeds converted to `<br />` tags and no attempts to infer paragraph breaks.  This is actually by design, as it is recommended that you do your txt->HTML conversion on your computer rather than letting Books.app do it.  Future versions may have an option to do "smart" conversion, but this will still be only "smarter" in the sense that a cow is "smarter" than a housefly.
  * Changing text size when in the middle of a chapter/file may screw up your scroll point.  I am working on a solution to this problem, but I don't know whether it will truly solve it, or even if this problem is solvable given the state of the iPhone SDK.
