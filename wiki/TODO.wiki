As of 8/10/2007
  * Implement persistence, so the application picks up where you left off when you re-open it.
  * Implement real-time text resizing, ideally via simple taps and double-taps.
  * Fix the FileBrowser so it shows only directories, .txt, and .htm(l) files.
  * Handle .txt files properly.
  * Simplify the process of getting books copied to the phone via shell-script or full Cocoa app.  Integrate GutenMark on the server side.
