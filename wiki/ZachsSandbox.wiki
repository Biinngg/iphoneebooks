This section is where I'm posting my thought process.  It may or may not be of interest to anyone.

===how to figure out how many characters/page?===

The following formula gives a decent approximation of how many characters are rendered on the portrait screen:

265000 / (font size^2^)

For instance, with 20 point text this yields 662 characters.  How can I use this to determine which page we're on?

Well, if via the scroll-point (determined by pixels, not text) I discover we've scrolled three pages down, then I only have to render (3 `*` 662) = 1986 characters when the user loads the page, and do the rest in the "background."  Loading in the background is still a synchronous process, but at least the user would be able to read the page they're on.

Of course, if a user wants to come back to a page which is mostly read, it would still take a long time to render the text regardless.
